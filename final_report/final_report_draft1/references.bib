abstract = "Cloud synchronization and sharing services (CS3) for Science, Education and Research aim at providing new ways of accessing, sharing and interaction with existing data repositories as well as providing new type of storage services. We present the background and context in which CS3 services developed. We also introduce selected scientific contributions from the CS3 community, and from relevant research beyond, to illustrate some of the technical challenges for on-premise file sync/share services in Education and Research."
